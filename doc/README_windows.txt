Intro
-----
Datacoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties. Datacoin implements the first scientific computing proof-of-work for
cryptocurrencies. The unique proof-of-work design searches for rare prime
formations, providing experimental value for mathematicians to further
understand the nature and distribution related to prime number, a simple yet
mysterious construct of arithmetic that continues to baffle the top minds of
mankind.


Upgrade
-------
First backup wallet. Uninstall previous version and then follow setup
instructions. Double check balance after completing setup and starting up
client.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run datacoin-qt.exe.

Datacoin-Qt is the original Datacoin client and it builds the backbone of the
network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Datacoin
transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection,
the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
